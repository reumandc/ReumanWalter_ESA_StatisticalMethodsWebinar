\section{Introduction}

%In this Intro, we probably better put some of the caveating and provisors and citations
%we are presently putting into our review. This is not the only way to consider timescale
%specificity of synchrony, there is lots of other work on the subject, would be good
%to respect some of that work before going on with our way of doing it. 
%Maybe could have an example from an old Fourier paper (not even looking at synchrony) - timescale-specific methods have been used in ecology forever
%Maybe have an example of a "precursor study" or two where you can see they are talking about timescale-specific things. And maybe also changes through time (mention a couple early papers showing changes in synchrony). 
%Through decades of work by many researchers, the field has matured, helped at every stage by 1) long time series, and 2) ever improving statistical methods. This is one reasonably complete suite of such methods, but other authors use variant methods and so on which are also good and also allow us to learn about ecosystems.
%And the methods all overlap, being based on now-standard standard wavelet tools, differing in details we won't go into 
%Mention some of the other authors. 
%Our way of thinking about methods has been implemented in wsyn

\section{wsyn and synthetic examples}

%Somewhere above here you need to say the viewpoint is operational, i.e.,
%we talk about what these tools can get you and how you intepret it. Main ideas. 
%No time for detailed math, but we can provide some references if you want. 

%We should probably have a "reference" section in the github where we put:
%1) Torrence and Compo
%2) Some of our papers
%3) The wsyn vignette pdf
%3) A longer reference list

%You also want to mention, Dan, that the codes for this are in the github for the 
%seminar, and these are abbreviated from the vignette, so you have those two 
%resources, the latter in greater depth than what I have time for here.

\subsection{Wavelet transform}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{The wavelet transform}
\begin{itemize}
\item All the tools we discuss today are based on the wavelet transform
\item So we start by introducing it
\item Data are one time series
\item As for all the tools we introduce today, we provide an operational understanding
\item Very light on the mathematics
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{How to use the wavelet transform}
\begin{itemize}
\item Given a time series $x(t)$, the wavelet transform, $W_{\sigma}(t)$ is a complex number with:
\begin{itemize}
\item magnitude the strength of oscillation in $x(t)$ at time $t$ and timescale $\sigma$
\item phase the phase of that oscillation
\end{itemize}
\item So it decomposes variation by timescale, and tells you how that changes through time
\item You could also think of it as a time-windowed Fourier transform (but done correctly)
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Example of wavelet transform: make some data}
\begin{block}{Fake data characteristics}
\begin{itemize}
\item One time series, sin wave of period 15, then switches to 8...
\item Plus white noise
\end{itemize}
\end{block}
\begin{exampleblock}{Make some fake data}
\begin{verbatim}
time1<-1:100; time2<-101:200; times<-c(time1,time2)

ts1<-c(sin(2*pi*time1/15),0*time2) #starts period 15
ts2<-c(0*time1,sin(2*pi*time2/8)) #then period 8
ts3<-rnorm(200,mean=0,sd=0.5) #add some white noise

ts<-ts1+ts2+ts3 
\end{verbatim}
\end{exampleblock}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Example of wavelet transform: apply \texttt{wsyn::wt}}
\begin{exampleblock}{Apply \texttt{wt}}
\begin{verbatim}
ts<-wsyn::cleandat(ts,times,clev=1)$cdat
wtres<-wsyn::wt(ts$cdat,times)
\end{verbatim}
\end{exampleblock}
\begin{block}{Notes}
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{cleandat} demeans time series (can also do more)
\item \texttt{wtres} is an S3 class defined for wavelet transforms
\item Default values for other \texttt{wt} arguments are good for exploration
\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\subsection{Ways to show time and timescale structure of synchrony}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Displaying how synchrony depends on time and timescale}
\begin{itemize}
\item This talk covers an approach to exploring how synchrony depends on timescale...
\item and how it changes through time
\item So we next introduce methods for displaying the time and timescale structure of synchrony
\item Data are multiple time series from different locations
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{The wavelet phasor mean field (\texttt{wsyn::wpmf})}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item For timeseries $x_n(t)$ in $n=1,\ldots,N$ locations
    \item For wavelet transforms $W_{n,\sigma}(t)$
    \item The WPMF is $\frac{1}{N} \sum_n \frac{W_{n,\sigma}(t)}{|W_{n,\sigma}(t)|}$
    \item In other words average the ``phasors'' $p_{n,\sigma}(t)= \frac{W_{n,\sigma}(t)}{|W_{n,\sigma}(t)|}$
    \item A ``phasor'' is a unit-magnitude complex number
    \item It gives phase synchrony as a function of time and timescale
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{The wavelet phasor mean field - gives a detailed picture of synchrony}
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[height=8cm]{./figures/WPMF.png}
  \end{center}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Example of the wpmf: make some data}
\begin{block}{Fake data characteristics}
\begin{itemize}
\item Several time series
\item All have one underlyig signal, switches from period 10 to 5 mid way
\item All have randomly phase-shifted period-3 sine ways
\item Plus white noise, independent in each signal
\end{itemize}
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Example of the wpmf: make some data}
\begin{exampleblock}{Make some fake data}
\begin{verbatim}
times1<-0:50; times2<-51:100; times<-c(times1,times2)
ts1<-c(sin(2*pi*times1/10),sin(2*pi*times2/5))+1.1 

dat<-matrix(NA,11,length(times))
for (counter in 1:dim(dat)[1])
{
  ts2<-3*sin(2*pi*times/3+2*pi*runif(1))+3.1
  ts3<-rnorm(length(times),0,1.5)
  dat[counter,]<-ts1+ts2+ts3    
}
dat<-cleandat(dat,times,1)$cdat
\end{verbatim}
\end{exampleblock}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Example of wpmf: apply \texttt{wsyn::wpmf}}
\begin{exampleblock}{Apply \texttt{wpmf}}
\begin{verbatim}
wpmfres<-wsyn::wpmf(dat,times,sigmethod="quick")
\end{verbatim}
\end{exampleblock}
\begin{block}{Notes}
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{wpmfres} is an S3 class defined for wpmfs 
\item Default values for other arguments are good for exploration, see docs and vignette for details
\end{itemize}
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]

\end{exampleblock}
\begin{columns}[c]
\begin{column}{6cm}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../results/synthetic_results/WPMFExample_wpmf.pdf}
\end{column}
\begin{column}{6cm}
\begin{itemize}
\item We get significant synchrony at timescale 10, initially, then at timescale 5
\item So we detect the time- and timescale-specific synchrony that was built into the data
\end{itemize}
\end{column}
\end{columns}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Significance of the wpmf}
\begin{itemize}
\item Null hypothesis: random, independent phasors
\item Significance means phasors are significantly more aligned than that
\item Note: as always, you need to keep multiple testing in mind
\end{itemize}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{../results/synthetic_results/WPMFExample_wpmf.pdf}
\end{center}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{The wavelet mean field (\texttt{wsyn::wmf})}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item We also use the ``wavelet mean field'' $r_\sigma(t)=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^{N}w_{n,\sigma}(t)$
    \item Where $w_{n,\sigma}(t)=W_{n,\sigma}(t)/\sqrt{\frac{1}{NT}\sum_{n=1}^{N}\sum_{t=1}^{T}W_{n,\sigma}(t)W_{n,\sigma}^{*}(t)}$ is a normalized wavelet transform
    \item The wmf uses magnitude as well as phase information, gives more complete information but a bit more complicated
    \item Can interpret it in a similar way
    \item But no straightforward significance testing!
    \item We often show both
    \item See \texttt{wsyn} vignette for details on how to call the \texttt{wmf} function
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Benefits of a timescale-specific approach to synchrony so far}
\begin{itemize}
\item The example shows some benefits to a time/timescale-specific approach over classic correlation-based methods
\item Correlation methods did not show synchrony, since those methods conflated timescales and averaged across time
\item Synchrony on some timescales was obscured by asynchrony on others
\item We can now see the synchrony and see its structure
\item It turns out that timescale structure is very common in synchrony
\item It turns out that changes through time are also common, and a consequence of climate change
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Wavelet coherence}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Starting to explore causes of synchrony}
\begin{itemize}
\item We know that one important cause of synchrony is the Moran effect
\item How do we start to explore that in a time/timescale-specific viewpoint?
\item Our approach is based on ``wavelet coherence''
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{The basic idea of wavelet coherence, by analogy}
\begin{itemize}
\item Our method will 
\begin{itemize}
\item quantify the consistency of the phase relationship between signals, through space and time
\item and compare that to what would be expected if the signals were unrelated but each had the same degree of phase drift across space and time
\end{itemize}
\item It is the very irregularity of biological time series that makes this method work
\item Clock analogy
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Spatial wavelet coherence}
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{wsyn} has a spatialized wavelet coherence tool to detect relationships between variables in a timescale-specific way
\item $w_{n,\sigma}^{(1)}(t)$ and $w_{n,\sigma}^{(2)}(t)$ normalized wavelet transforms
\item $w_{n,\sigma}^{(1)}(t) (w_{n,\sigma}^{(2)}(t))^{*}$ has phase equal to the phase difference
\item $\frac{1 }{NT}\sum_{n= 1}^{N}\sum_{t=1}^{T} w_{n,\sigma}^{(1)}(t) (w_{n,\sigma}^{(2)}(t))^{*}$ measures consistency of phase differences across time and location 
\item This sum is large when phase differences are consistent across space and time...
\item and small when they are not consistent
\item We compare against the same thing calculated for randomized ``surrogate'' datasets
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Example of spatial coherence tools: make some data}
\begin{block}{Fake data characteristics: environmental data}
\begin{itemize}
\item Data consist of an environmental driver and a biological variable, both measured at $11$ locations
\item The environmental variable is the sum of:
\begin{itemize}
\item a weak common signal, period $10$
\item a strong common signal, period $3$
\item white noise 
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{block}
\begin{exampleblock}{Make the fake environmental data}
\begin{verbatim}
times<-(-3:100); lt<-length(times)
ts1<-sin(2*pi*times/10)
ts2<-5*sin(2*pi*times/3)
x<-matrix(ts1+ts2,11,lt,byrow=TRUE)+
  matrix(rnorm(11*lt,0,1.5),11,lt)
\end{verbatim}
\end{exampleblock}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Example of spatial coherence tools: make some data}
\begin{block}{Fake data characteristics: biological data}
\begin{itemize}
\item population time series were the 3-step moving average of the environment 
\item plus white noise
\end{itemize}
\end{block}
\begin{exampleblock}{Make the fake biological data}
\begin{verbatim}
times<-0:100; lt<-length(times)
y<-matrix(NA,11,lt) #the driven (biological) variable
for (i in 1:101) {
  y[,i]<-apply(FUN=mean,X=x[,i:(i+2)],MARGIN=1) }
y<-y+matrix(rnorm(11*lt,mean=0,sd=3),11,lt)

\begin{columns}[c]
\begin{column}{5cm}

\begin{itemize}
\item Add concreteness through application to a real question
\item Discuss some challenges posed by real-world data for application of methods

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Empirical example: kelp wrack on beaches near Santa Barbara, CA}
\begin{itemize}
\item Giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) is a rocky reef foundation species
\item Its detritus provides a major resource subsidy to sandy beaches
\item Can kelp forest synchronize beach dynamics through provision of wrack?
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Preparing data for analysis}
\begin{itemize}
\item Analyses in \texttt{wsyn} require complete, regularly spaced time series

\item Fill any gaps with beach- and month-specific medians
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Responsible gap-filling for synchrony analyses}
\begin{itemize}
\item Avoid borrowing information from neighboring sites. This can build in artefactual synchrony.
\item Be cautious with temporal structures---preserve things that have well-defined periods and consistent amplitudes, e.g., seasonal and diurnal cycles.
\item It may be impossible to responsibly fill many/large gaps. We have generally avoided analyzing time series with more than 20\% or so missing values, when there are several consecutive missing values, and when many/all locations are missing data simultaneously.
